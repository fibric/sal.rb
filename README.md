# sal.rb

sal.rb is a simple attribute language for Ruby. This project is a refactor of [RuHL](http://github.com/stonean/ruhl) that will use [Temple](https://github.com/judofyr/temple) and [Tilt](https://github.com/rtomayko/tilt).

## This project will follow the completion of [sal.js](https://github.com/stonean/sal.js)
